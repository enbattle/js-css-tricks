Ways that I've found to create the styling for a notification ticker:

Absolute Positioning - we can use absolute position for the ticker element and use left, right, top, and bottom css properties to reach the positioning wanted (even with responsive designs)

Floating Element - we can place both the ticker and the button icon in the same container element, make the position relative, and then make the ticker float to the right side
                  (i.e. right, inline-end) and then use the left, right, top, and bottom CSS properties to reach the positioning wanted
